# Hi Visitor :>

Welcome to my GitHub page! As of now, there isn't much to see here because I'm going to start on a new journey into coding.
## What to see in here?

I'll be sharing open-source code for fantastic web templates and other projects here, allowing everyone to contribute.

### Cautions

Before forking my works please be sure to:

* Do not remove the footer credit but you can add your name or company name on it (e.g. Initium - Company Name)
* Do not claim as "I have created" but "I have contributed" 
* All the files I share here are not for sale and should not be used for profit. Failure to comply with this can lead to serious consequences.
